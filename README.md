## üìñ About The Project

Wandr is a smart, hands-free travel assistant that turns navigation into a conversation.  
Instead of manually typing and juggling multiple apps, users can simply **talk or text** their plans.  
Wandr processes natural language, understands complex multi-stop requests, and builds optimized routes‚Äîmaking travel both **safer** and **more enjoyable**.

### Inspiration
Navigation apps today aren't built for how humans actually communicate. Drivers are forced into rigid commands, creating unsafe distractions. We imagined: *what if trip planning was as natural as talking to a friend who knows the area?*  

That idea became Wandr.
