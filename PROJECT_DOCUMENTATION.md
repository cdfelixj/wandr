# Wandr Project Documentation

## Inspiration

The inspiration for Wandr came from a fundamental problem we all face: **navigation systems are not designed for how humans actually communicate**. Traditional GPS systems force drivers to manually input destinations while driving, creating dangerous distractions. They require rigid, specific commands instead of understanding natural language.

We were inspired by the vision of making navigation human again. What if you could simply say "I need to get a haircut before my date at 5" and have an AI system understand your intent, find the best salon, and create an optimized route that fits your schedule? What if navigation could be as natural as talking to a knowledgeable friend who knows the area?

The core inspiration was transforming travel from a mechanical, manual process into a **conversation**. We envisioned a future where drivers could focus entirely on the road while an intelligent assistant handled all the complex routing decisions, learning from their preferences and adapting to their needs.

## What it does

Wandr is a smart, hands-free travel assistant that turns travel into a conversation. Instead of searching and screenshotting, users simply text or talk: "I need to get a haircut before my date at 5" and Wandr translates your intent into real routes using voice recognition, Gemini, Cohere, and Google's routing APIs.
